A plugin that helps people share your content via powerful quotes.

== Description ==

A plugin that helps people share your content via powerful quotes. Provides an interface for sharing selected text directly to twitter along with a link to the original content, and credit to the author. Also provides an interface on blockquote elements for sharing those quotes directly.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

After that the plugin should just work. Try highlighting text on a page to see the quotable toolbar popup, and look for the quotable toolbar added to the end of the `<blockquote>` elements in all of your posts.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can you add the option to share quotes on more social networks? =

I may add integration with certain websites or services as time goes on, but my main goal is to make sharing content simple and quick. Too many options could work counter to that goal.

= How do I add an author who gets credit the the shared content? =

You can use Yoast's WordPress SEO plugin to set a site-wide Twitter account and a Twitter account for each user. When a tweet is created with the plugin, those values will be used to give credit where credit is due.

= How do I add hashtags to the shared content? =

Hashtags are generated based on the wordpress tags that were used on the post.

== Screenshots ==
1. The plugin will add a quotable button to the end of all blockquotes. When the button is clicked, a new Twitter window is created with the quoted or selected text.
2. When text is highlighted, the quotable toolbar will show up.
