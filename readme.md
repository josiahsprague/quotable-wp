A WordPress plugin that helps people share your content via powerful quotes. Provides an interface for sharing selected text directly to twitter along with a link to the original content, and credit to the author. Also provides an interface on blockquote elements for sharing those quotes directly.

## Get it yourself

You can either download and install the zip manually, or find the plugin on WordPress.org

http://wordpress.org/plugins/quotable/

## See it in action
If you want to see this plugin in action without installing it yourself, check out this page on my blog: http://josiahsprague.com/destination-isnt-point/

Look for the Twitter bird on the blockquotes near the bottom, and try selecting some text with a mouse and see what happens.

## Things to do

In no particular order

[ ] Add detection for twitter:// protocol to open links in app if installed - it looks like this might not be possible, if anyone has an idea for how to make this work, let me know.
[ ] Don't add quotable link to paragraph elements that are citations
[ ] Add option to share on reddit
